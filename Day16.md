# TypeScript vs JavaScript: Key Differences

**TypeScript** enhances JavaScript by adding static typing and advanced features for large-scale applications. It offers:

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript enforces type checks during development, reducing errors and enhancing code quality.
- **Type Annotations**: Clear documentation through type annotations, aiding code readability and maintenance.
- **Compile-Time Checks**: Errors are caught during compilation, reducing runtime surprises.
- **Advanced Tooling**: Enhanced code intelligence, navigation, and autocompletion in IDEs.
- **Interfaces & Generics**: Structured type definitions and reusable code patterns.
- **ES6+ Compatibility**: TypeScript supports the latest JavaScript features.
- **Strict Mode**: Allows you to define stricter type checking rules.

**JavaScript**, on the other hand, is a dynamic scripting language. It offers:

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can change types during runtime.
- **Simplicity**: Faster development due to looser syntax and fewer constraints.
- **Ubiquity**: Widely supported by browsers and server-side platforms.
- **Learning Curve**: Easy to learn and quick to get started.
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic nature allows for more rapid prototyping.

Both languages have their strengths. TypeScript is preferable for complex projects where strong typing and
