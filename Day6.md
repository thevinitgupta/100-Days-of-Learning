# Encryption - The Secret Code

`Encryption` is like a secret code for your messages.
Imagine a magic box that turns words into special symbols only you and your friend understand.
When you send the box to your friend, they use their own magic to turn the symbols back into words.
This way, only you two can read the message, even if someone else tries to peek.

## Why??
- People use encryption to keep their messages safe when sending them on the computer or phone.
- It's like having a secret language that only you and your special friend can understand! ðŸŽ©ðŸ’ŒðŸ”’
