# Learning TypeScript: Day 1 - Understanding Basics and Setup for Development
Today, I start my journey with Typescript. And I will be sharing it as I learn. 

> Typescript is JavaScript's superset with static typing, in-line code checks, and a large set of support libraries.

## Highlights of Typescript as a language

- **Enhanced JavaScript Applications:** TypeScript is designed for large-scale apps. It brings improved development tools, static code analysis, compile-time type checks, and comprehensive code documentation.

- **Flexible Code Generation:** Choose ECMAScript version 3 or newer. All your existing JavaScript code remains valid in TypeScript.

- **Transpiling, Not Just Typing:** TypeScript's compiler isn't just about types. It transpiles human-readable source code into another, enabling better compatibility.

- **Type Annotations for Clarity:** Use lightweight type annotations to document function and variable contracts, making your code more readable.

- **Empowered Compiler:** TypeScript's compiler analyzes, warns, and optimizes. It performs static code analysis, emits warnings/errors, and merges code for performance.

- **Type Inference and Compatibility:** TypeScript can infer types and ensure compatibility between elements, even in structural typing.

- **IntelliSense and IDE Support:** Enjoy intelligent code suggestions in IDEs, catch errors early, and enhance productivity.

- **Safeguarding Your Code:** TypeScript minimizes runtime errors by enforcing type checks, reducing surprises during execution.

## Setup for Development

To set up your TypeScript development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Begin by installing *ts-node* and *typescript* either globally with npm:

    ```js
    npm install -g ts-node typescript
    ```

    Or locally:

    ```js
    npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
    ```

2. **Configuration with tsconfig.json:** Create a *tsconfig.json* file to define compiler options. Start with [noImplicitAny](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitAny) to avoid requiring types for all variables:

    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "noImplicitAny": false
      }
    }
    ```

3. **Real-time Compilation:** Utilize *ts-node* for immediate TypeScript compilation and execution:

    ```js
    npm run ts-node -- yourfile.ts
    ```

4. **Type Definitions:** Leverage TypeScript's input validation by defining precise types for inputs. This enhances accuracy and provides value information in your code editor.

5. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling where necessary, particularly when dealing with external interfaces or unexpected inputs.

With these steps, your system is ready to harness the power of TypeScript for smarter and safer development.
